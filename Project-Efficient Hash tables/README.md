# Efficient Hash tables

To cope up with the fast developing world, the computers need to speed up and provide better
computation power than the old versions. This being said, most of the systems in the current day
are multi-thread supported. But is it being used to the fullest? Absolutely not!. If we can make
use of these multi-thread supporting architecture to at least a remarkable extent, then it would
make a significant revolution in terms of computation power and speed. Leaving this aside, the
Hash tables are one of the most used and popular data structure which is very well known for its
speed in look ups, inserts and deletes. In this course project, we are trying to make hash tables
parallel and concurrent so that most multi-threaded architecture makes most of it. We are going
to implement the following in C++.

The main motivation for choosing this project is to fasten the fastest data structure, even a
small addition to efficiently use the hash tables is a significant addition I think. More detailed information is provided in the report.
